## An Analysis of Stack Overflow Survey Data 2017
The first project for the Udacity Data Science nanodegree using 2017 Stack Overflow survey data.

### Installations
I used the standard python packages for data manipulation and visualization: numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
Python version: 3.7.4

### Motivation
This project is used to practice data science skills, to familiarize with the data science process, and to fulfill the requirement of the Udacity data science nanodegree. I specifically ask the following three questions:
*Question 1: Is there a gender gap in terms of salary for developers?
*Question 2: Which developer types have the highest career satisfaction?
*Question 3: What kind of activities developers most frequently do on Stack Overflow?

### Files
I did this analysis on Jupyter Notebook and the details are included in the file "DS Nanodegree project 1 - SO 2017 Survey Analysis.ipynb". The data files are from Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2017 and can be found [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017)

### Summary of findings


### Acknowledgement
